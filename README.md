# Simple-Calculations-App
A C# app that calculates the sum, difference, product and quotient of two integers.

The user inputs two integers and can then select the buttons "sum", "diff" (difference), 
"prod" (product) or "quot" (quotient). The "clear" button clears the integers in the
textboxes and "exit" closes the application.
